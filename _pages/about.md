I write about <strong>data engineering</strong> in real life. My name is <a href="https://github.com/deniswoliveira">Denis</a>, and I started out as a data analyst. Since then, I've worked on BI Report Developer, Python Developer as well as cloud engineer finishing as a data engineer.<br>
I Love to study new techs and become fascinated with the data engineering field for having so many possibilities.<br><br>
It is not my goal to be the smartest person on the internet, but to share what I have learned.
